# Expense Report Data Warehouse and Analytics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Expense Report Data Warehouse and Analytics project. This project involves creating a database for tracking expense reports filed by employees at a manufacturing company and analyzing the data through various SQL queries.

## Project Description

The project is based on a script `create_expense.sql` which creates a database comprising seven tables: employees, trips, expenses, dept_codes, reason_codes, account_codes, and reimbursements. These tables collectively manage the data related to employees' expense reports.

### Key Components

- **Data Warehouse Creation**: The `create_expense.sql` script initiates the data warehouse with seven detailed tables.
- **Data Analysis with SQL**: In  `Data Warehouse and Analytics.sql`, I perform various SQL queries to extract and analyze data from this data warehouse.
- **Documentation**: `Data Warehouse and Analytics.docx` documents the entire process, including the creation of the data warehouse and the execution of SQL queries.

### Objectives

- **Designing a Data Warehouse**: Creating a warehouse that combines data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of the company's expense reporting.
- **Analyzing Expense Data**: Crafting SQL queries to analyze various aspects of expense reporting, such as total amounts spent by department, number of trips per reason, and total reimbursements per department.

### Queries and Analysis

1. **Number of Trips by Reason**: Understanding the distribution of travel purposes within the company.
2. **Total Amount Spent by Department**: Insights into the spending patterns of different departments.
3. **Total Trips by Department**: Overview of departmental travel frequency.
4. **Reimbursements per Department**: Financial implications of reimbursements across different departments.

### Usage

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the creation and analysis of an expense reporting data warehouse. It is particularly useful for students and professionals interested in database management and SQL querying.

### Tools Used

- SQL: For creating the data warehouse and performing data analysis.
- Microsoft Word: For documentation and explanation of the processes and findings.
